## Simulation Details

A complete-real simulation with [dyn4j physics engine](https://github.com/dyn4j/dyn4j)

### Swerve-Drive Physics Simulation, 
Fine-tuned with data measured in our training field, the swerve drive simulation provides an incredibly realistic drivetrain characteristics.
It simulates the behavior of each individual swerve module using [WPILib DCMotorSim](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/simulation/DCMotorSim.html) and use the data from 4 modules together to simulate the force on the drivetrain.

### Game Pieces and Intake Simulation
In our simulation, game pieces on the field has collision spaces and can interact with the robot.
It also allows teams to simulate a fixed intake module on the robot that grabs a game pieces whenever in-contact.

### Opponent Robots Simulation
Simulated robots that can either be controlled by a gamepad to play defense or follow pre-stored cycle paths.
Just as real robots, opponent robots have collision spaces.
This allows drivers to practice defense/offense.

### Odometry Simulation

Odometry Simulation with realistic characteristics such as skidding and the IMU drifts.

### Vision Simulation with
Built Upon [PhotonLib Camera Sim](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/simulation/simulation.html), our vision simulation behaves exactly the same as a real vision system
The system uses April Tags to position the robot on field, and teams can tune the system without a field

We also Provide a convenient feature that generates [Advantage Scope Fix Camera Config](https://github.com/Shenzhen-Robotics-Alliance/Maple-Swerve-Skeleton/blob/main/src/main/java/frc/robot/utils/CustomConfigs/PhotonCameraProperties.java) automatically, which allows you to see the camera's view in advantage scope with easy steps to set up, [Source Code](https://github.com/Shenzhen-Robotics-Alliance/Maple-Swerve-Skeleton/blob/main/src/main/java/frc/robot/utils/CustomConfigs/PhotonCameraProperties.java)
